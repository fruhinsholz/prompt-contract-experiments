# LOW Retrieved Context

## 1. What This Experiment Shows

This experiment tests whether the label `LOW` hides an operational dollar threshold inside model judgment. The model sees the same refund case each time, but the surrounding retrieved context changes: no extra fact, a nearby `$5` gift-card note, or a nearby `$100,000` contract note.

The claim is narrow. This does not prove a universal threshold for any model. It shows that when a system lets the model decide what `LOW` means, nearby context can move the observed decision boundary while the actual refund case stays unchanged.

## 2. How It Works

- Runnable script: [src/low-retrieved-context.mjs](../../src/low-retrieved-context.mjs)
- Shared provider and result harness: [src/shared/harness.mjs](../../src/shared/harness.mjs)
- Prompt spec: [specs/low.md](../../specs/low.md)
- Retrieved-context fixture: [specs/low-retrieved-context.md](../../specs/low-retrieved-context.md)

The script runs a bounded binary search over refund amounts from `$0` to `$20,000`. At each candidate amount, it samples the model multiple times and estimates `P(LOW | amount)`. The search narrows the band around the point where `P(LOW)` crosses the target probability, then adds more samples at the final low and high endpoints.

The important files are `userPrompt()` for context injection, `runAdaptiveBandSearch()` for the probability-band search, and `buildOpenAiPayload()` / `buildGeminiPayload()` for provider calls.

Binary-search example for the `gpt-5.6` `$5 gift card context` row above:

`P(LOW | amount)` means the observed share of calls that returned `LOW` for that amount. For example, `$39.06` returned `LOW` in `21` of `30` calls, so `P(LOW | $39.06) = 70.0%`. The search first samples broad midpoints, then spends extra calls only at the final band edges.

| Epoch | Amount | Search step | Calls | LOW | NOT_LOW | P(LOW) |
| ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | $0 | boundary low | 10 | 10 | 0 | 100.0% |
| 0 | $20,000 | boundary high | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% |
| 1 | $10,000 | binary midpoint | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% |
| 2 | $5,000 | binary midpoint | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% |
| 3 | $2,500 | binary midpoint | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% |
| 4 | $1,250 | binary midpoint | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% |
| 5 | $625 | binary midpoint | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% |
| 6 | $312.50 | binary midpoint | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% |
| 7 | $156.25 | binary midpoint | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% |
| 8 | $78.13 | binary midpoint | 10 | 2 | 8 | 20.0% |
| 9 | $39.06 | binary midpoint | 10 | 7 | 3 | 70.0% |
| 10 | $58.59 | binary midpoint | 10 | 1 | 9 | 10.0% |
| 11 | $39.06 | band refine | +20 | +14 | +6 | 70.0% cumulative |
| 11 | $58.59 | band refine | +20 | +4 | +16 | 16.7% cumulative |

That run used `160` calls for this model and context. A fixed `10`-call sample at only those same visited amounts would have used `120` calls, but it would not refine the final band edges. A fixed grid fine enough to guarantee the same `$19.53` spacing across `$0` to `$20,000` would require roughly `10,250` calls.
Run note: the GPT 5.x run uses `--max-output-tokens 1024`; a lower `256` budget was not used for publication because it could truncate the final label after reasoning tokens.

## 4. Conclusion

The experiment shows that `LOW` behaves like an implicit dollar policy. When the policy is left inside the prompt, nearby context can move the boundary. A production system should define the threshold outside the model, version it, log it, and use the model only for work that does not decide the threshold itself.
