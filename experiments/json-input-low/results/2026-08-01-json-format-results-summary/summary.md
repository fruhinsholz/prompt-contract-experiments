# JSON Format Results Summary

Supplementary probe for the Prompt Edits article. This file consolidates the JSON-format result set used for the article-facing table. Some inputs were generated at different times; the table reports the observed result set rather than treating any pass as canonical by itself.

## Result Table

Highest tested claim amount classified as `LOW` by majority vote.

## Gemini $100k Detailed Rows

The Gemini `$100k` result is not a smooth threshold. Several cells are non-monotonic: a higher amount can receive more `LOW` votes than a lower amount in the same prompt format. That is part of the result, not a row to discard.

## Data Notes

- The table is a compact article view, not a benchmark ranking.
- The Gemini `$100k` enforcement cell remains `$20,000` because `$20,000` is the highest tested amount with majority `LOW` in the consolidated result set.
- The detailed rows show why this should not be interpreted as a reliable model-side enforcement boundary: the same explicit `$100` policy field produced `NOT_LOW` at many amounts above `$100`, but majority `LOW` at `$15,000` and `$20,000`.
- This strengthens the practical conclusion: pinning a threshold in model input is better evidence of intent, but consequence-bearing enforcement still belongs outside the model.
